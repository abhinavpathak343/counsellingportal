Counseling Management System 🎓
📌 Overview
The Counseling Management System is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This platform facilitates a centralized counseling process, allowing students to register, select their preferred branches, and get branch assignments based on their rank.

The admin manages student registrations, ranks students, assigns branches, and provides real-time updates. The system also includes Google Authentication for secure access.
